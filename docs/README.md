# FAQ

1. Does extension guarantees that all orders will be booked?

_No. Auto Book feature is designed to automate clicks. It will guarantee that 'Book' and 'Confirm' buttons will be auto clicked when new load appears. However, there could be potential issues and system failures when booking an order which extension does not have control over such as 'Order has been modified', 'Order does not exist anymore', 'Failed to fetch' etc. Anytime extension tries to book a an order and fails, look at the lower right side of the dashboard for a reason to failure._

2. When there is a change in Relay Website, how long it will take the extension to retrofit those changes?

_When Amazon Relay updates the site there could be possible issues with the extension. We usually resolve those issues right away, but every change to the extension needs to go through compliance review process with google which varies from few days to weeks. We will do our best to communicate those changes through our channels to keep the users updated._

3. Auto Book missed some orders, what should I do?

_Again, extension does not guarantee that all orders will be booked without fail. There are quite a few reasons for that to happen which we do not have control over._

4. Can you increase the refresh rate to more than five?

_Update per second is relative to response we get from Amazon servers. Every refresh needs at least 200 milliseconds to resolve. That is why you see loading indicator on the screen. Increasing speed will cause loads fail to appear on the board. We are working on potential solutions to overcome this. Thank you for the patience._

5. Can I use Relay Auto Booker in different machines at the same time and different Relay account?

_Extension is tied to the google account which was used to buy the extension. To use the extension in different machine, just login with that account. Extension can be used simultaneously and does not have any relations to relay account. So it can be used with multiple Relay accounts._

6. How can I install the extension?

_For how to install, please follow this link [How to install the extension](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/2664769?hl=en)._

7. How does the Max Stop feature works?

_Think about this as a limiting the amount of stops. Example, if Max Stop is set to 3, Auto Book and Highlight will ignore loads more than 3 stops._

8. What happens when there are not any load but similar matches are available?

_Extension will ignore loads under 'Similar Matches'._

9. Where can I see the extension in Action?

_You can find product demonstration in our youtube channel. [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJud09aGrK02h5tU_I4xUAQ)_
